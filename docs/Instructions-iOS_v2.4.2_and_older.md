### CleverTap Disable IDFV Usage

From CleverTap Unity SDK 2.1.2 onwards, you can disable the usage of IDFV by checking `CLEVERTAP_DISABLE_IDFV` as shown below

By default, the value of `CLEVERTAP_DISABLE_IDFV` is not checked which means CleverTap will continue to use the vendor identifier for the purpose of profile creation.
