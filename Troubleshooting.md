## Troubleshooting Guide for common integration issues in Unity iOS/Android plugin

### Android

**1. Not getting any callbacks for deeplink/inbox etc. in the game object?**
    
    Make sure that the name of the game object where you want the callback is "CleverTapUnity".
    Otherwise, you won't receive any callback.

**2. Getting build errors after adding FCM or any other SDK's?**

    Please check once the version of the PlayServiceResolver which you are using in your project.
